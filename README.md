# Workshop For React

A helpful repo while conducting a React workshop ðŸ˜„ ðŸš€

## Thanks goes to

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- [Kent C. Dodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-workshop) for his [react-workshop](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-workshop) upon which this one is based.
- [React Docs](http://facebook.github.io/react). Some examples have been lifted from there.

## Note

This repository will be useful while teaching React.

## Setup

You need to have the latest [`node`][node], [`npm`][npm], and [`git`][git] installed. Then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/j33n/workshop-for-react.git
cd react-workshop
yarn run
```

### All set up!

If you want to explore a bit, there are a few things you can do:

1. go ahead and open `basic/exercises-final/01-js.html` in a browser (don't peak at the solution!). It should say `Hello World`. Go ahead and open the others if you like.
2. Then you can run `yarn run storybook` and open `http://localhost:9009` and poke around the storybook for our exercises :)
3. Then you could run the app with `yarn start`. This should pop open a window with an app which we'll be building.

### Any errors?

If you see any errors, read the output and try to follow any instructions. If that doesn't work, feel free to
[file an issue](https://github.com/j33n/workshop-for-react/issues/new) to ask for help and I'll help if I can. Good luck!
